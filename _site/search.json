They also need to be able to interact with the data easily to perform various what-if analysis. The application’s motivation is driven by the discussed user needs as well as to obtain an efficient end-to-end environment of data pre-processing, data visualization creation and analysis. The objective is to provide the law enforcement agencies in Kronos and Tethys with an analytic tool for discovering visual behaviors and patterns of the network relationships in emails, credit card transactions and car movement paths.\r\n\r\n\r\nIssues & Problems\r\nThe following issues and problems were addressed by our project.\r\nStatic visualizations tend to have many overlapping issues.\r\nOur interactive application allows users to filter and zoom in on selected data.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth static visualizations and many minimally interactive visualizations that had been performed on this case study are not able to draw out hidden patterns. For example, in the network graphs, many visualizations did not make use of the edges and nodes characteristics to represent additional information about the relationships.\r\nTo address the issue, our project combines eigenvector centrality and community detection in the visNetwork graph, introduced bipartite network graph to model matching data between credit card transaction and location and employ tmap on a Raster image to visualize GAStech employees’ vehicle movement across different datetime.\r\n\r\nMost visualizations performed in non open-source platforms does not allow user to replicate the visualization easily.\r\nOur project uses R programming, enabling high reproducibility for users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Process Flow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow are the tools used for building the application:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Tools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExploratory Data Analysis\r\nThe Plotly interactive scatterplot and box plots also allow us to see patterns easily as crosstalk was activated between these plots. The box plots also help inform us of anomalies. For example, there are outliers in terms of number of emails sent on a Thursday and Wednesday and the investigators can highlight these anomalies to get more information on who sent it and when they sent it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Exploratory Data Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNetwork Analysis\r\nThe network plot shows the relationship of employees through their email interactions. The arrows represent the direction of the email sent. The email subjects in the data table in the visualization also provide more information about the nature of the interactions. The node sizes are a reflection of the nodes’ eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality measures a node’s importance while giving consideration to the importance of its neighbors and a person with few connections could have a very high eigenvector centrality if those few connections were to very well-connected others. There are many filter functions in the network visualization to enable end user to select the information they need for a focused or general analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Network Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBipartite Network Analysis\r\nThe bipartite network graph is very useful in modeling matching information in a visually informative manner. In our application, We can easily see the card transactions of GAStech employees at various locations at specific date, time and frequency depending on the user’s filtering choice at the sidebar panel. There is also a data table in the visualization to allow user to get further information of transaction price.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Bipartite Network Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeospatial Analysis\r\nGPS coordinates where the employees tend to stop the vehicles for more than 2 minutes are plotted as bubbles on the map. Transparency threshold is set on the bubbles in order to overcome the overlapping issues due to multiple input selections. Tool tips are also utilized efficiently and effectively to display the information such as department, designation, date, vehicle start time and stop time. Data table containing the credit card details and timestamp of the transactions are displayed below so that the users can infer the owners of the credit cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Geospatial Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\nAll visualizations provide new perspectives in interacting with the data to uncover patterns and anomalies.\r\nWith all visualizations, user can identify possible formal and informal relationships. For instance, informal relationships can be covered through focusing on non-work related emails that are likely a result of personal relationships, after-work vehicle movement to demonstrate movement patterns in their personal time, after work transaction purchases at the same location and time by the GAStech employees could suggest that they might be together at the same location, possibly meeting each other.\r\nWith bipartite network visualization, user can visualize the transaction patterns of GAStech employees and also uncover frequent places that GAStech employees go to at specific date and time.\r\nThe spatial data visualization also allows user to infer the identity of the credit card owners by comparing the data table and their vehicle stopping location shown on the map.\r\nThe network data visualization allows user to infer who are the most influential employees, communities detected through the email interactions to help us uncover relationship in groups that might be otherwise undetected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work\r\nIn future, we could explore whether the node colors could dynamically change depending on selection of grouping by department or Eigenvector centrality interactively on the Shiny app itself. The Bipartite Network plot can be further improved in the future to incorporate the centrality measures filter.\r\nThe Shiny application can also be refined further to allow users to select various network layouts to see which one helps to better visualize the community relationship in the network. This give users the autonomy and additional interactivity feature by enabling them to explore the network layout to use that can better support their visual analysis.\r\nAt present, cross talk linked brushing functionality is not compatible with tmaps and VisNetwork. In future, we would be able to use linked brushing for tmaps and VisNetwork with data tables or other compatible widgets if crosstalk expands their existing compatible HTML widgets to those widgets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Visual Exploration for VAST Challenge 2021 - The Kronos Incident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Context\r\nIn the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.\r\nIn January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.\r\nAs experts in visual analytics, our group are called in to help the law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys.\r\n2. Dataset Overview\r\nOur team is working on the VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 1 Dataset and VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 2 Dataset.\r\nVAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 1 dataset includes current and historical news reports, resumes of numerous GAStech employees, organization chart and two weeks of email headers to come up with the visualizations among all of these people and organizations.\r\nVAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 2 dataset includes data on credit card transactions, loyalty card membership transactions, GAStech employees’ vehicle GPS movements, and GAStech vehicle assignment.\r\n3. Motivations and Objectives\r\nOur team aims to build a web visual analytics driven application that can help law enforcers detect anomalies and visualize relationships and conditions among all the people and organizations related to the kidnapped victims. This will help the law enforcers identify the link between various news sources, emails, events and activities to aid them in their detective work and solve the case.\r\nOur analysis in the form of practice research paper on this website using Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)’s template of rticles for R Markdown and the visualisations will be built on the ShinyApp using R to complement our analysis.\r\n4. R Packages for our Analysis\r\nR Package\r\nDescription\r\nshiny\r\n‘shiny’ is an R package that allows easy development of interactive web apps. It allows various interactive features to enhance the user experience.\r\nggplot2\r\nThis package allows creation of graphs that represent both univariate and multivariate numerical and categorical data.\r\nplotly\r\n‘plotly’ has an R graphing library which helps in creating interactive, high quality graphs for line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, etc.\r\ntidyverse\r\nIt includes a variety of related packages for data manipulation and data visualization in R.\r\nggnetwork\r\nNetwork geometries to plot network objects with ‘ggplot2’, which is necessary for building network graph by ggplot.\r\nvisNetwork\r\nvisNetwork package allows the building of network visualizations to visualize complex relationships between different elements.
